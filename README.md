- 👋 Hi, I’m @L3Lenz (L Lenz)
- 👀 I’m interested in generating and mining new and existing datasets to for insights on immune cell function and regulation of immune responses in health and diseased states - particularly infections and inflammatory conditions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply bioinformatics and data science methods for analysis and visualization of complex datasets, specifically bulk and single cell RNAseq. Towards this, I am learning/improving skills in R, python, linux platforms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning, testing, and sharing of data, results, pipelines, best practices, code.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email: lenzlab@gmail.com
